            <h1 class="text-center">Different Types of Developers</h1>
            <br><br>
            <p>As a developer you might be aware of some fields in software development that you want to explore but you might be confused on which one to select as a career pathway. Each field of software development is unique in its own way and uses different languages, frameworks and tools to meet the requirements. Here are several different fields that will help you to understand their particular roles and which one you want to dive into.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>1. Web Developers</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Web developers are those who create websites that you use or see in a browser. There are three rather four sub-divisions in the field of web development viz. Front-End developer, Back-End developer, Full-Stack developer and Middle-Tier developer.</p>
            <h4>&#8226; Front-End Developer</h4>
            <p>These are those web developers who focus on client-side development. These develop the UI/UX of a website (user interface and user experience) which basically means how a website is going to look and feel to the user. The basic languages these developers uses are HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
            <h4>&#8226; Back-End developer</h4>
            <p>These develop the server-side area of a website which includes how the website is going to work from the backend, what is it going to do with and of the information that you provide to it, and how is it going to perform tasks like placing orders, registering your ID or signing you in. These developers are able to use several languages and frameworks for their development like C++, Python, Ruby, PHP, etc.</p>
            <h4>&#8226; Full-Stack developer</h4>
            <p>These developers can do both Front-End and Back-End development and thus have the ability to create a fully functioning website on their own.</p>
            <h4>&#8226; Middle-Tier developer</h4>
            <p>These developers do not have specific knowledge of either Front-End or Back-End development instead they have some basic knowledge of both. These are rare to find and hence often even excluded from the list of types of developers.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>2. Data Scientist</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Data scientists are those developers who use statistics to extract useful information from a bunch of data sets. These perform tasks like statistical analytics, data visualization, machine learning, etc. These developers use languages like Python and R.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>3. Big Data Developer</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Big Data developers are those developers who deals with huge amount of data. They retrieve huge amount of data make sure that all the data is stored in an easily accessible manner. These developers use languages like SQL, Python, R and Scala.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>4. Application/Mobile Developer</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Application developers or mobile developers are those developers who build the mobile apps that we use. These are generally platform specific like Android and iOS. The programming languages often used for building applications are Java, Kotlin for Android, Swift for iOS and Flutter(Dart) for both android and iOS.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>5. Desktop Developer</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Desktop developers are those who build application softwares for your desktops. These are also platform specific eg. Windows, Linux, OS X, etc. These developers use a wide range of programming languages like C, C#, Python, Java, Python and so on.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>6. Game Developer</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Game developers are those developers who build games. These can be classified into several sub-categories like android game developers, ios game developers, windows game developers, web game developers and so on. However, the basic skill set of these developers include Unity (2D &amp; 3D) , Flash, etc. These developers generally use languages like C#, C++, Java, Python, etc. in order to build the game physics and define behaviour of characters, etc. A special type of Game developer specialized in developing graphics may also be termed as Graphics developer.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>7. DevOps Developer</h3>
            <br>
            <p>DevOps developers are those developers who build and deploy systems to execute backend code on these systems.Such developers use languages like Go, Ruby, Python and JavaScript.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>8. Embedded Developer</h3>
            <br>
            <p>These are those developers who develop programs ans systems for microchips, microcontrollers, hardware devices, etc. These programmers majorly use languages like C and C++.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>9. Security Developer/White Hats</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Security developers are the developers who find security issues in a software or system and fix them up, so no one can exploit the systems through those loopholes. These developers or hackers (white-hats) generally use the assembly language, C and C++.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>10. Automation Testing Developer</h3>
            <br>
            <p>These are those developers who write code to automate the process of testing using some defined parameters and tools. These developers majorly use the Python programming language. Some other languages that can be used in this field of development are Ruby, Java, JavaScript and C#.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>There are some other types of developers rising now-a-days like WordPress developers about whom you can read on various websites but these are generally subsets of the above stated developers in some way or the other.</p>
            <p>Now you will have to decide which pathway you want to choose for yourself. It is better to have a deep knowledge of one as a developer rather than having a shallow knowledge of several fields of development, however you may be aware of some basic tools in different fields until you are making progress into the field you have selected. So select one and start working on it today.</p>
