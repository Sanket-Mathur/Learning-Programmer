            <h1 class="text-center">Why Learn C</h1>
            <br><br>
            <p>While many people think C is an old programming language and don't help much in the modern times while others call it as the language of gods. Here are a few key points on why you should learn C as a programming language and what are the features in C that are makes it so special that even today this 40 years old language is holding its place in the top 10.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>1. Why and Where was C Invented</h3>
            <br>
            <p>C was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 in Bell Laboratories. It was created to make utilities to run on UNIX. Later it was applies for reimplementing the kernel of UNIX operating system. It has been standardised by American National Standard Institute (ANSI) since 1989 and subsiquently by International Standardization Organisation (ISO). C is an special language as other programming langauge are mostly written in another language but C was mojorly built using C itself. It was later used to build several other high-level languages that we use today. Adding further, almost all of the operating systems are built using the C language.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>2. Communicates with The Machine</h3>
            <br>
            <p>C is a mid-level language i.e. it contains qualities of both high level and low level languages. It is very well optimized for communicating with the machine. It can directly communicate with the CU(Control Unit) and thus control all the memory allocations, operations and functionality of the machine. The concept of pointers is an example of well communication between the language and the machine. C program is a lot shorter and easier than assembly and thus is a much better option to get started with when it comes to go deep into the machine.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>3. Builds a Strong Base</h3>
            <br>
            <p>If you are looking for a programming language to begin then C might be one of your best choise. C consists all the concepts of any other programming language like loops, functions, command parameters etc. which will build a strong base for you if you want to proceed to any other language. Also C++ is pretty easy to start with once you start understanding C as C++ is nothing but an object oriented layer on top of C which add a little bit of functionalty over the C language. Also you can do almost anything with C however not all other programming languages gives you this level of dynamic capability.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>4. Fast and Optimized</h3>
            <br>
            <p>C being a mid-level language is highly optimized since it communicates well with the memory and machine. Writing your programs in C can reduce the run-time of your application by a ton. Some other languages like python might be a bit easier to learn but are a lot slower than C. This doesn't mean python is slow but you can surely see the difference once you start writing huge programs.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>5. Easy to Get Started</h3>
            <br>
            <p>C is a pretty easy language to get started as it being old also means that you have a ton of resource online regarding to this language. If you are a beginner and still not sure whether to get started with C or not, click the button on the right which will take you to my GitHub project where I have explained the basics of C within C programs as comments that you can study and then run directly to see how the work; OR click this link <a href="https://github.com/Sanket-Mathur/Learn-C" target="_blank">https://github.com/Sanket-Mathur/Learn-C</a>.</p>
