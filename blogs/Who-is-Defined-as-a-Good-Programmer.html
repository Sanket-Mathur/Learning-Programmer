            <h1 class="text-center">Who is Defined as a 'Good Programmer'</h1>
            <br><br>
            <p>Have you ever wondered how to become a good programmer? You can easily become a programmer by studying programming languages, building and working on projects and/or working for a company in the development related fields; but here are a few points you need to take care about if you want to become a 'Good Developer'.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>1. Become Fluent in Your Field</h3>
            <br>
            <p>When talking about programming, comes a lot of various fields. Front-end web development, back-end web development, data scientist, application developer and android/ios developer to name a few. You need to be clear about where you want to head to while also keeping some knowledge of other fields as well since you never know what will be doing practically. Which ever field you choose, be absolutely fluent with it. You must be implementing efficient algorithms and writing error free code.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>2. Don't Depend on Internet</h3>
            <br>
            <p>As you get started with programming, you will need help from more experienced developers for knowing their way for solving problems you are currently facing. You can use the medium of internet for this and it is the best way of communicating with the community as I have already stated in my earlier blogs. But try to soak in as much information as you can; you need to gain enough information that you won't be surfing internet if you meet that error ever again.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>3. Focus on Your Softskills</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Softskill is an important area of one's personality that many of the people don't worry about. Developing your application or website don't mean anything until you can explain all of its features to the person/group sitting in front of you. You need to have a presentation equivalant or better than your project but not lower in any situation. Even if you are planning to do freelancing, you need to have good communication skills to make the client believe you enough to hire you.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>4. Do Everything in a Planned Way</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Plan your whole day, week, month, and even year. Plan in advance about when you want to start with a new project and when to complete it, and even how many projects you want to work on at once. You need to have well followed plan that if someone asks you anything about your projects or free time, you should come straight to the point instead of just beating about the bush.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>5. Stop with the Excuses</h3>
            <br>
            <p>When you are working with technology, there is a lot that could go wrong; and most of the time whatever could go wrong will go wrong. For example, something you have built on your system may not work properly on your college system which may occour due to different OS, not all the files are installed, file locations might not be synced and so on. But the main part is to identify the problem and rectify it instead of giving excuses for your application not working.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>6. Don't Hesitate</h3>
            <br>
            <p>This is a more generalized point that you should follow if you want to good at anything. If you know about something and are sure about it, don't ever hesitate to answer any question related to it if asked from you. Though while answering try to be as polite as you can, respect the point of view of others and never opt a rude attitude while explaining something to someone even if you think he/she doesn't believe what you are saying or doesn't understand what you want to express.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Focus on what you are doing and try to notice the application of all these points in your daily life in order to realize the seriousness of these. Implement them in your real life and start becoming a good developer today.</p>
