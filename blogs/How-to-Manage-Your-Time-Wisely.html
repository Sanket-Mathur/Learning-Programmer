            <p>Do you waste more hours of your day than you want to? Or do you want to manage your time for getting good grades? Here are a few tips that you can use to manage your time and reduce time wastage.</p>
            <p>&#8226; Smart Goal Setting</p>
            <p>&#8226; Divide Time and Set Limits</p>
            <p>&#8226; Spend Mornings for Most Improtant Tasks</p>
            <p>&#8226; Eliminate Activities Wasting Your Time</p>
            <p>&#8226; Be Ready for Sudden Alterations</p>
            <p>&#8226; Don't Wait if You are Done</p>
            <p>&#8226; Invest Time Towards Long Term Goals</p>
            <p>&#8226; Consider All the Breaks You Need in Advance</p>
            <p>&#8226; Stay Away From Stress</p>
            <p>&#8226; Turn Off Social Media Alerts</p>
            <br>
            <h3>1. Smart Goal Setting</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Set your short term and long term goal but set goals that are relevent and achievable for you. Don't over burden your mental capacity and try to shape it for better over time. Expecting too much from yourself straight from the beginning might harm your schedule by demotivating you and reducing your will to follow it.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>2. Divide Time and Set Limits</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Different tasks and subjects need different time spans accordingly. Divide your time based on the requirement of your subjects. Being a student of programming concepts and languages, spend more time reading or understanding for theoritical subjects like about the Operating Systems or Algorithms while more on practice and projects on the rest. Try to complete you tasks within these limits.<p>
            <br>
            <h3>3. Spend Mornings for Most Important Tasks</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Mornings are the most important for doing any task as you mind is in its best condition at this time. After sleeping for about a good 6 hours, your mind comes back to the routine completely refreshed. This is the time when you have the maximum efficiency and productivity. So this will be the best time to complete all of your improtant and urgent tasks.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>4. Eliminate Activities Wasting Your Time</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Notice the every day routine you have without any time management implemented and observe which of the activity you perform wastes most of your time. It might be some mobile games or social media or watching random videos on YouTube. In such situations, either stop using them or limit the use of them. You might even deploy an application to track usage or lock the device after a defined span like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.goozix.antisocial_personal&hl=en_US" target="_blank">AntiSocial</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zerodesktop.appdetox.qualitytime&hl=en_US" target="_blank">QualityTime</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>5. Be Ready for Sudden Alterations</h3>
            <br>
            <p>No matter how well you have planned your schedule but there will always be various alterations. You will have to work some extra hours out of your comfort zome but this is the only way on maintaining a healty routine and management of your time.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>6. Don't Wait if you are Done</h3>
            <br>
            <p>If you have completed your tasks then don't waste your time waiting the clock to hit 12 for starting the next task. If you have another subject to study after it or if it is a 15 minute break. Start it the moment you finish your previous task. Don't waste you time and thus making a time talbe is not professional way of managing your time as the alteration intensity will be quite high.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>7. Invest Time Towards Long Term Goals</h3>
            <br>
            <p>While your short term goals, might be to complete your syllabus in the first couple of months of getting good grades this semester, are important; don't forget about your long term goals. They are the reason you are here completing these short term goals. Your long term goals might be to become a good developer or getting fluent with programming and algorithms or even improving the search engine ranking of your website. Whatever it is, start investing you time in it from today.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>8. Consider all the Breaks you Need in Advance</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Breaks are what encourages you to follow your schedule sincerely. However, taking breaks too often are even harmful since you need some time to build your complete interest and attention in the topic you are studying. Taking break even before an hour will not be that benificial than taking a 15 minute break after 1.5 to 2 hours. Or even better is to take break between each task to get refreshed for the next one, but be careful on what you spend this break time for.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>9. Stay Away From Stress</h3>
            <br>
            <p>With any limit on you, you will always tend to take stress of the tasks you will have to perform in that time limit or after. However, stress should be as low as possible as it might lead you to overthink and waste time thinking about things that are not even relevent. So try to keep you stress as low as possible and keep working on your current activity.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>10. Turn Off Social Media Alerts</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Social Media is one of the greatest distractions in todays world. Any notification might distract your mind making you wonder about who might have texted you or what is in a photo you friend just uplaoded. Whatever it might be but in most of the cases, it will lead you to waste atleast 10-20 minutes out of your schedule. So the best practice is to turn off these alerts. Or my advice will be to keep your mobile's ringer volume on silent or vibration.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Start managing your time by following these tips and remember to neither think about upcoming tasks nor the upcoming breaks while doing something and you will be ready to go with your own wisely scheduled routine.</p>
