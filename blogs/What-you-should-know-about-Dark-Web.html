            <p>Almost all of us have heard of the term dark web somewhere but here is a brief explanation of what it really is. Go through the blog and discover some bits about it.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>1. What is Dark Web</h3>
            <br>
            <p>You might have came across the term Dark Web several times via news papers and reports regarding to some criminal activities. But the question is what is dark web? The answer is nothing but the web that is not indexed by search engines.<br><br>The web we generally use in our day to day life is called the surface web, however even after it looks like a massive store of data, it only occupies roughly 4% to 5% of internet. Rest all is what considered as the deep web and the dark web. This portion of the internet is kept separated from crawlers that index a website in search engines.<br><br>Though 95% might seems to be a fairly large quantity, most of it is actually deep web which is used to keep the data safe and far from being indexed. This might include you average sign-in to a website or money transactions. The actual dark web only takes up to 6% of the internet which if you compare to the size of surface web today, it huge as well.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>2. What is the use of Dark Web</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Dark web being intentionally encrypted and hidden, is mostly used for purposes that aren't really legal. These include things like malwares and phishing to major security breaches and credential displays. You might think that you passwords are secure enough but in reality, it might have already been extracted in a security breaches and could be present in the dark web for anybody to use.<br><br>The dark web is a foreground for black-hat hackers i.e. the hackers who want to exploit someones system for malicious purposes (also called as crackers in general terms).<br><br>Dark web being so secure, cannot be surfed using normal browsers and require a specific browser (tor browser) and also the websites are not general .com or .co websites but uses the suffix .onion. Dark web is full of trackers that would like you exploit your system for their profit, so it is always suggested to use a secure and trusted VPN (virtual private network) if you ever do so.<p>
            <br>
            <h3>3. How to stay safe</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Though the best practice to keep your passwords different for every website and using strong passwords containing 10+ characters with a combination of alphabets, symbols and numbers.<br><br>A web site to check if you passwords are leaked in breaches (that might be available online) is <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com">HaveIBeenPwned</a>. Though being in a few breaches can be alright since not all breaches are that severe and big, if the number comes out to be more than 5 or 10, you should definitely consider changing all your passwords.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Focus on what you are doing and try to notice the application of all these points in your daily life in order to realize the seriousness of these. Implement them in your real life and start becoming a good developer today.</p>
