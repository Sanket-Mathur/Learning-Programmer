            <br><br>
            <p>Have you been wondering how much time you should invest in programming as a beginner? Here is an overview of things that you need to consider when planning your schedule. These points will not tell you exactly how long you need to spend with your PC but will tell you how to understand it yourself and make an effective schedule for yourself.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>1. Practice all the Topics you have Learnt</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Practicing what you have learnt is one of the most improtant part of programming. No matter if you are studying it in your university, school or from an online book or course, practice what you have learnt no matter how much time it takes you to rectify all the errors and get the code working. Most of the concepts you learn in programming keeps on repeating themselves as you move along the language but keep you hand gripped on all of those as this is what going to help you code faster than others and typing straight to the machine rather than searching you book or web for a basic syntax.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>2. Experiment with the Code</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Once you are done practicing all you have learnt today, start experimenting with your code and let your creativity flow through your code. Try finding new ways of writing the same code, create your own algorithms, try to reduce the time complexity and experiment with different values to deeply understand how the code in working. Spend atleast half the time you spent in learning the topics and feel free to search online in case you come across any error but try to understand rather than just copy and pasting the code. Go to such websites that provides you with documentation of the code along with the examples and use.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>3. Manage your Time</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Time management is a very important aspect if you are getting started with programming as you can stay stucked on a simple problem for hours without any indications of getting out of the situation, wasting all of your time that you could have spend in order to practice more. I have also written a seperate blog on time management so check it out in case you need a detailed explaination on <a href="How-to-Manage-Your-Time-Wisely.html">How to Manage Your Time Wisely</a></p>
            <br>
            <p>Wondering how much time to invest in programming will be for a short period. After that your ability and will to move further will drive you deep into programming and in no matter of time you would be spending most of your day into programming without even realizing. So start strong and don't overthink about it too much.</p>
            <p>I myself started with spending with an hour or half daily towards programming depending on my assignments in my intermediate and today I'm easily spending 2-4 hours everyday along with my studies in college and other subjects. And I'm still waiting to proceed to higher levels so I can spend more of my time with programming and learing new stuff.</p>
