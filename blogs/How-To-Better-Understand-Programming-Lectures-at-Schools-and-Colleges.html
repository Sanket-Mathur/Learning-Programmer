            <p>Do you want to better utilize lecture related to programming? Or are you not able to cope with your lectures right now? Here are some tips you might want to follow in order to get the most out of the classes.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>1. A Good Seat</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Having a front seat in the lecture hall might help you become a better programmer however sitting on last seats doesn't make you a bad one in particular. Pick a seat in your class room where you can listen to the professor more clearly and maintain your distance from other distractions. Usually the seats anywhere from the second/third row till the mid of the hall are observed to have the best experience sound and volume wise. If speakers are installed inside the hall, try not to sit very close to speaker and maintain a gap of 5-7 seats between you and the closest speaker.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Where having a seat next to a window can get you a nice breeze but also you are more likely to get distracted by something going on outside; like watching some birds fly or watching guy on a horse on the street. However having a clear view of the hallway might get you distracted by some people walking by or some students running outside.You might be someone who cannot be easily distracted but it is better to prevent having a seat next to mischievous students.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To sum it all up, find some seats away from possible distraction and mischievous students. This might mean that you will have to arrive a couple of minutes before the students taking up those seats but it will be worth it.</p>
            <br>
            <br><br>
            <h3 >2. Quick Revision</h3>
            <br>
            <p>When you are studying a programming language, it is preffered for you to have a book to accompany your studies. Even with the study of frameworks, libraries or methodologies, some reference or study material is generally provided by the lecturers. If not, you are always open to abundance of books and materials on the web. Here are some of the sources I use.</p>
            <p>&#8226;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks</a></p>
            <p>&#8226;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">w3school</a></p>
            <p>&#8226;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pdfdrive.com" target="_blank">pdfDrive</a></p>
            <p>&#8226;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a></p>
            <br>
            <p>Let's say that you have a book which covers all the topics taught to you today, but the question is how to read it?</p>
            <br>
            <p>You can spend hours reading everything in detail but to be more efficient, you do not need to spend that much time reading the material, instead spend your time in programming and experimenting but more on that later. The most efficient way to go through your book is be selecting the topics taught in the class today and reading them. Quickly glance over the things you already know while spending more time on some detailed stuff that wasn't taught that well or deeply in lectures.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You should not spend most of your time reading books. Where reading is important, try to minimize the time wisely.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>3. Most Important: Practice</h3>
            <br>
            <p>When you are learning to program, the most important part is to be able to write programs and practicing every day is what going to help you write good programs and effective algorithms. The concept of basic programming that you learn are never forgotten when you practice as they keep on occouring as you go along the course. Here are a few webites you can try out your skills on and get questions to practice.</p>
            <p>&#8226;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hackerrank.com" target="_blank">Hackerrank</a></p>
            <p>&#8226;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hackerearth.com" target="_blank">hackerearth</a></p>
            <p>&#8226;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.codingninjas.in" target="_blank">Coding Ninjas</a></p>
            <br>
            <p>Firts thing to do after reading or revising the topics is to try it out yourself on your system. Once you get that running, start experimenting with it based on your personal proramming knowledge and see if that works. In case of any error or you getting stuck somewhere, pick up your study material or notes and try to find a fix to that problem. If you still can't find a solution, try googling stuff and get your solutions. You can also take help of your friends and more experienced programmers if you know some or through forums.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To end it, you should spend at least the amount of time you spent attending the tecture or the time span of your class today. This will make sure you are spending enough time to practice what you have learnt and will set the concepts in your mind. Practicing daily will also help you improving you rtyping speed which will make you more productive and will help you in future.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In order to get the most out of the lectures, you need to follow all these on a daily basis and try not to leave a single day left out. Remember, even if you didn't attended the class for a couple of days due to certain circumstances, it doesn't mean that you are going to lag behind but it means that you need to spend more time reading and practicing.</p>
