            <p>While several people don't like Python as their main programming languages, you can't deny the fact that it is one of the fastest growing and highly wanted language in software industry today. Here are a few facts explaining why Python is the most famous programming language and why should you learn it.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>1. Where it all Started</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Python was first released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum. However, it has recently started gaining a lot of popularity, especially after the release of Python3 in 2008. It all started as a large-scale project but later when it started getting popular it got functionality in several different fields and today is used in almost all the fields of software development.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>2. Used in wide Variety of Fields</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Python can be used to build just about anything. It has been quite popular for scientific programming and data science. It supports a lot of libraries like Numpy and Scipy for scientific calculations, Pandas for dealing with data, Matplotlib for data representation, etc. Also, the python library Django is the most used web framework. Beyond this, it supports game development with the framework Pygame, Desktop development with Cocoa, PyGTK, and also some hardware programming, network programming, DevOps development, etc.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>3. Easy to Write</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Basic python is a pretty easy to learn and write specially if you already know the basics of programming. Python doesn't use braces to define the blocks, however, it is based on indentation i.e. spaces and tabs. In addition to that, you don't need to place semicolon after every statement, unlike other languages. Though with it being easy to write, come a hamper. Python is a lot slower to compile that languages like C and C++.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>4. Career Opportunities</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Python being used in so many fields, brings a huge career opportunities. A lot of big companies use python, Google, Facebook, Instagram, Spotify to name a few. Most of the companies and start-ups choose python as their major language because of its easy to read and understand behaviour and that's why it's called friendly to engineers.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>5. How to get Started</h3>
            <br>
            <p>There are a ton of resources on the web from where you can learn python. A lot for courses has been created and a lot of books has been written for those who want to get started with python programming.
