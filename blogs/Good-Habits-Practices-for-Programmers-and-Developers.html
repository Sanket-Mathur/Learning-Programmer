            <br><br>
            <p>Do you consider yourself as a programmer? Do you spend more time in developing and learning more than anything else? Do you have to sit in a same place for hours working on your computer? This might effect you lifestyle, body posture and health. Here are some tips which might help you learning things faster saving some time for your self and maintaining a balanced lifestyle.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>1. Get Good at Basics</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Before you take a deep dive into hardcore programming, get fluent with basics of any programming language and all general concepts. Keep practicing them since these will build the foundations of all the things you will learn in future making them easier to learn and quick to implement, instead of getting stuck at some basic concepts and then surfing internet to get it resolved.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>2. Observe all Details</h3>
            <br>
            <p>If you want to learn anything, start it from the roots. For programming, pay some attaintion to the documentation and read all the parts of the book you are using since the details and useful stuff get well hidden in them. Even if you are reading someone else's code for either help them or to understand it or even to learn something out of it, pay attaintion to the detail in order to closely understand their algorithms and coding style.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>3. Healthy Life-Style</h3> 
            <br>
            <p>Many programmers gets too much into programming. So much that they even leave going out their house. While this might help you finishing your projects before submittion data but they will hurt you a lot in long term as stated in the first paragraph. However, you can follow some basic things in order to stay healty. Firstly stop ordering pizza and get cooking. Cook something healthy even as simple as a salad if you don't have enough time. Go for a walk at least once a day for 60-90 minutes; this will help you get some fresh air and will refresh your brain. You might even find a fix for the bugs you were stuck on for hours, after you return from the walk. If possible, hit some cardio or join a gym to maintain an even better body posture.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>4. Invest Time in Problem Solving</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Problem solving might not be that iteresting for some while a great way to practice coding for others. However it will help you develop your brain to have a computational thinking. This will help you in many ways, from making more effective algorithms faster to recognizing and removing errors and bugs from your code and ofcourse improving your coding skills. Also, problem solving is one of the major skills recruiters see while the interview.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>5. Often take Breaks</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Consider taking short breaks while you sit on your chair programming. After every 1-2 hours of coding, you should take a 10-15 minutes break. This break will help you refreshing your mind and giving a little rest to your eyes. These are very useful for resolving some issues in your code or iproving your productivity and speen by removing the fatigue. Use these breaks to stand in your balcony or making yourself a cup of coffee if you are working late at night. Make sure you don't spend this break checking your instagram as using naother screen won't relieve your eyes and thus there is not point of even taking a break.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>6. Be Friends with Search Engines</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Being a programmer means dealing with a lot of errors and bugs. You should get good at debugging but some errors are tough to solve. In such situations, googling it out might be the easiest way to get it fixed though it is not good to rely too much on the internet for fixing your errors but this is a skill you must have in order to deal with some problems. Learn some specific ways to make your search more effectiove in reaching to the desired website and giving you the most useful search results.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>7. Stay Updated</h3>
            <br>
            <p>As a person highly related to technology, it is really important to stay updated about the things happening around you. Any new useful invention only takes a couple of years before everyone starts following it and it is better to get your hands dirty before others jumps into it too in order to get the most out of it.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>8. Make Projects</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Start makig some projects out of passion. This will give you the best suited environment and opportunity to deal with some real life problems, learn a lot of new useful concepts for your project. These projects can be done either individually or in a group of some free and interested programmers. It is one of the best way to get fluent with programming concepts and will definitely help you in long term.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>9. Don't Give Up</h3>
            <br>
            <p>With programming comes a lot of errors, bugs and issues and let's say Google isn't always helpful. you will have to fix them on your own and they aren't always easy and some might take hours even days to resolve. The only thing you can do is think and think and think but the key is to never give up thinking. Keep trying out new stuff and start to read over and over again. You will eventually come across a solution or a new way to solve your problem.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>10. Stay Curious</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Curiosity is what keeping a man alive and learning new things and same is with programming. Always keep learning new things and experimenting with what you already know. This will help you remember various concepts and will make you a better programmer overall.</p>
