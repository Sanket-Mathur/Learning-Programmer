            <p>Finding a good resource online is not easy now-a-days with the abundance we have access to. Either you are looking for a book or a course online or anything other than that, you will come across a lot of authors, service/course providers and lecturers. So go through this blog talking about finding the best suited resources for you.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>1. Preview the Course</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Everyone of us have different needs and requirements and hence same books and courses cannot be equally efficient for all. While some teachers online might feel good to me but makes you sleepy while another one might be exciting for you but speaks too fast for me to understand. Same is with authors and their writing styles.</p>
            <p>Most of the course providers like <a href="https://www.udemy.com" target="_blank">Udemy</a> and <a href="https://www.coursera.org" target="_blank">Coursera</a> provide you an option to preview the course however the ways can be different e.g. Udemy shows a single video as course preview while coursera allows you to enroll using audit mode for a week.</p>
            <p>Preview several courses providing you with required knowledge before getting started. Find the best suited course or book which makes you excited to learn new concepts while also being completely understandable and relatable. This will make sure that you are getting exactly what you wanted and makes you satisfied that you are getting the best from what you could.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>2. Consult and Read</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Before getting started with anything you can spend some time in consulting about the course. You can do this online or even offline with your friends or seniors having similar interest as yours and those who have already done such courses. This will give you a base line of what others recommend and where others faced problems when they were going through this.</p>
            <p>You will find various people online or on social media pages taking about how good a particular book is, but be aware that these influencers might be getting paid to promote a particular book or a course. Find a relevant audiance and platform where you can see genuine thoughts and comparison between different resourses.</p>
            <p>However make sure doing this doesn't delay your plans and you shouldn't doubt a resourse too much making you spend more that 1-3 days finding the flaws in it.</p>
            <p>Also don't forget to read the discription or syllabus covered in the course confirming that it will give you a precise and deep knowledge of what you are getting started with.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>3. Ratings and Reviews</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Well this might seems to be the most basic step while choosing anything online but most of don't follow it that much while looking for books and courses online. The problem with this is that when it comes to online education, most people don't express what then really feel while writing a review just as a sign of respect to the teacher or thinking that they are just not capable enough to understand what is being taught in the course. You should never decide which course to take just by their positive reviews however you should always consider the negative reviews as only a few people express their real feelings online.</p>
            <p>Not saying that you should have a negative attitude towards the teachers but the comparision of student count for enrolling and count of total reviews will for sure help you know how many students really liked it. Look for high number of enrollments/completions and then find which has the best ratio of reviews and enrollment. i.e. count of reviews divided by count of enrollment should be closest to 1.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Always stay curious to learn new techniques which will help you achieving your goal and make the best use of the online resources provided to you. Choose the best one matching your needs/requirements and dive into it.</p>
